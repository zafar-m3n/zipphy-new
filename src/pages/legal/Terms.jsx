        <p>
          While all information posted is believed to come from reliable sources, Zipphy does not guarantee the
          accuracy, correctness, or completeness of information available from its service and therefore will not be
          liable for any loss incurred. Zipphy reserves the right to make changes to any of its websites, trading system
          or members’ page at its discretion, at any time, without prior notice to its members.
        </p>

        <p>
          Due to the nature of computing, Zipphy websites and communications could fail at any given time. As such,
          Zipphy will not be responsible for unavailability of use of its website, nor undelivered e-mails due to
          Internet bandwidth problems, equipment failure, etc. Zipphy does not guarantee that the website or service
          will be continuous or error-free. Zipphy will not be liable for the acts or omissions of any third party with
          regards to delay or non-delivery of email or other means of notifications in regards to signal alerts or
          calendar event alerts. It should not be presumed that the methods, techniques, or indicators presented on this
          website and chart updates will result in profits or that they will not result in losses. Past results are not
          necessarily indicative of future results.
        </p>

        <p>
          Examples given on these pages are for educational purposes only. These set-ups are not of any order to buy or
          sell. The authors, writers, and all affiliates take no responsibility for your trading activity and results.
          Forex, cryptocurrency, commodity, and indices trading contains a high degree of risk.
        </p>

        <p>
          No guarantee is made that any follower will or is likely to achieve results comparable to those presented.
          There is often a large difference between theoretical performance and the actual results later reached by any
          trading platform. Furthermore, hypothetical Forex trading does not involve the risk of loss that exists in
          actual trading. There are many influencing factors related to either the market, in general, or to the
          specific implementation of any signal which can affect actual trading buy/sell results.
